I didin't look for or observe any flora or fauna today. 

But I opened this journal to write about our weather tonight. 

I'm sitting outside at 20:53 in Nashville and it feels amazing. There is a cool breeze. Cool enough to go grab socks, long PJs, and a light hoodie. And I could still use a blanket!

I think weather is an important aspect of a field journal. Changes in weather could be something worth noting. Not to get all mother-earth-hippie vibe, but the weather feels like the _spirit_ of our planet. It has emotion. It plays an integral part with what's living on earth. Heck, even the Bible makes a direct relation between the wind and life. 

The past day or so in TN has been _hot_. It was severely hot after coming back from the nice lakeside weather in Cleveland. Then, out of nowhere this afternoon, it's cooler than it was up north. The sky is clear and stars are visible. 

Based off Apple's weather app's future forecast, I have half a mind to say fall is here.
