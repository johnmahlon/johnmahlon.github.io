This afternoon Becca pointed out a massive, black bird flying outside our apartment. I went outside on the balcony to get a better view and saw the distinct, red head of a [[Turkey Vulture]]. 

Later on we decided to go hiking at Edwin Warner park around 17:00. It felt fantastic outside. Blue skies with a crisp, early Fall breeze. Colored leaves were already on the ground. Due to recent rain I imagine, there were actually small amounts of water in the creek bed. Plenty of [[Squirrels]] out and about. Even one [[Chipmunk]] was spotted by the bird fountain.

Out past the amphitheater, there is a mowed path through wild pasture. I used the [Seek app](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app) to scan all kinds of plants and insects. I found:
- [[Elm-leaved Goldenrod]]
- [[Wingstem]]
- [[Frostweed]]
- [[Tall Ironweed]]
- Two ...friendly... [[Goldenrod Soldier Beetles]]
- Many bees pollinating these plants
- One butterfly
- One [[Harvestmen]] spider trying to hitch a ride on my leg

After that, we hiked over to the nature center and watched [[Ruby-throated Hummingbird]]s at the feeders.
