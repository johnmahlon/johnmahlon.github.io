This morning I took a walk around my apartment complex and right off the bat I ran into what I thought was a wasp. It might actually have been a [[dirt dauber]]. I avoided it anyway!

Towards the end of the walk I spotted a [[Northern Mockingbird]] as well as a female [[Cardinal]]. There were lots of other birds I could hear, but not sure what they were.
