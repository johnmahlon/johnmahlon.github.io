Today I have decided to be an amateur naturalist. 

This morning, around 10:00 or so, I took a walk to see what I could find. There had been all kinds of noises going on between what I think is an owl, various birds, and insects in the tall grass outside of my apartment. 

I wasn't out very long but I identified two Northern Mockingbirds. With the help of the Merlin app. 

When Becca got home about 13:00, she came and got me to show me a Northern Walkingstick on our door. It's currently 16:30 as I'm writing this and it is still there. It's moved locations and now has a curled tail. 

In an afternoon walk around 14:45, I heard what Merlin reported as a Blue Jay based on the audio, although I'm not all that confident as I didn't see any blue when I saw the bird fly away. Granted, it says Blue Jays are not blue on the underside.
