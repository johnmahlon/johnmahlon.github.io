Soial Media Alternatives:
- [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) (X/Twitter)
- [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/) (Instagram) 
- [Aether](https://getaether.net/) (Reddit) 
- Note: There is something called ActivityPub, which is a protocol
        that defines the way decentralized social medias can work. 
        Mastodon uses it. Pixelfed uses it. Threads has implemented it!
        You can follow any ActivityPub account from any ActivityPub service.
        i.e. I can follow Threads accounts from my Mastodon account.

Alternative Web Protocols:
- Gopher: This is OLD, but still active. 
- [Gemini](https://geminiprotocol.net/): This is new. Similar to Markdown. 
    - I like the Lagrange browser for macOS [https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange](https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange)


Public Unix (or, Pubnix)
- [https://tildeverse.org/](https://tildeverse.org/) <-- Start here. 
- [rawtext.club](https://rawtext.club): Based around the "slow web". Build it yourself, take your time doing it. 
- [sdf.org](https://sdf.org): one of the originals 
- Note: There is A LOT here. Command line games, bulletin board systems, 
        chats, etc. Some even host an online radio station. 

Chat:
- IRC 
- XMPP (no clue what this is tbh)
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) (have to plug my fave)
