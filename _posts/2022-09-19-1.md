18:30 ET -- All times Eastern Time

Today I was at Rocky RIver Park in Rocky River, OH. I little bit West of Cleveland. It was around 18:30, and Becca, Michael, and I had gone to watch the sunset. I saw this was part of the Ohio birding trail and decided to watch some birds. There was a fairly large number of [Herring Gulls](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Herring_Gull/id) along with a few [Double Crested Cormorants](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Double-crested_Cormorant/overview) hanging out on a long rock "bridge". I'm not really sure what they were doing there. Resting? Waiting for food? Some of the gulls were just floating in the water.  

After sitting with Becca for a while she spotted a [Great Blue Heron](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Great_Blue_Heron/overview) fly in and land among the gulls. They respected the heron for sure. It had plenty of space on each side. It was also larger than the other birds. 

Around 19:15, it flew accross the beach and out of sight.
