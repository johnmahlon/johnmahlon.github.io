### Personal Life
Becca and I are living in Nashville and have recently traveled to Cleveland.

### Cleveland Trip
While away in Ohio we:
- Went to a White Sox/Guardians game
- Rode roller coasters at Cedar Point
- Looked at art and artifacts at the [Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/)
- Smelled some fragrances
- Watched a sunset over Lake Erie
- Check out the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
- Tons of other stuff

### Hobbies
I've recently been interested in nature and have been keeping field notes while hiking. I may keep an active field journal here on this website. I also just finished reading _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ and just began reading _Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage_.

### Work
I am currently working at AllianceBernstein as an iOS Developer in Nashville, TN.
